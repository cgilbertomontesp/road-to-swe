# 🛣️ SWE Preparation Journey

Welcome to my personal **Road to SWE** repository — a living archive of my journey toward earning a Software Engineering internship and future full-time role at a top global tech company.

This repo is more than code.  
It is the *system*, the *documentation*, and the *evidence of effort* behind months of disciplined preparation.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as **the central hub for everything related to my SWE interview preparation**:

- **Daily & weekly tasks** from my structured 12–week prep plan  
- **Data Structures & Algorithms practice** (solutions, notes, patterns)  
- **System Design basics**  
- **C++ practice & fundamentals refresh**  
- **Mock interview notes and reflections**  
- **Resources, summaries, and study templates**  
- **Mini-projects or exercises supporting interview preparation**

Everything here contributes to one overarching goal:

> ### ⭐ *Become a Software Engineer capable of thriving in the world’s most competitive tech companies — both technically and professionally.*

## 🚀 The Journey

I started this journey with a simple intention:  
**to maximize my chances of getting an internship at a top tech company and transition into a world-class engineer.**

To achieve that, I built a complete roadmap covering:

- Deep DSA practice  
- Understanding core CS fundamentals  
- Building real projects  
- Consistent mock interviews  
- Improving communication & problem-solving speed  
- Reviewing behavioral interview stories  
- Learning to write cleaner, production-level code  
- Tracking progress daily with Kanban boards, Trello, Notion, and Anki

This repo documents that entire process transparently — the good, the bad, the improvements, and the commitment.

## 🧗‍♂️ Philosophy

I treat this journey like training for a marathon or climbing a mountain:

- **Daily discipline > random motivation**  
- **Build systems, not just goals**  
- **Track everything, measure everything**  
- **Improve 1% every day**  
- **Think long-term: consistency compounds**  

My goal isn’t just to pass an interview —  
it’s to build the skills, habits, and mindset of a **high-level engineer**.

## 🏁 Final Goal

### ✔️ **Earn a SWE internship at a top company**  
### ✔️ **Transition that internship into a full-time SWE offer**
### ✔️ **Build a long-term career in engineering excellence**

This repo is the foundation.
